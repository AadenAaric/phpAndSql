1. Begin by installing XAMPP, a tool that provides an environment for running PHP and MySQL on your local machine.
   
2. Once installed, launch XAMPP.

3. Start Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.
   
4. Access phpMyAdmin by clicking on the "Admin" button next to MySQL in the XAMPP control panel. 

5. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database named "test" and within it, create a table named "registration" with 7 columns: ID, name, address, email, contact, gender, qualification, and ethnicity. Make sure to set the ID column as the PRIMARY KEY and check the A_I (Auto Increment) option.

6. Now, extract the folder provided and move it to the 'htdocs' folder in your XAMPP installation directory. Your folder path should look like this: Drive:\xampp\htdocs\'YourFolderName'.

7. Go back to XAMPP and click on the "Admin" button for Apache. Replace the "dashboard" part of the URL with "sohaibForm" to navigate to your site. 

8. Your site is now set up and ready to use.
