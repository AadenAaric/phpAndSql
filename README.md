5. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database named "test" and within it, create a table named "registration" with 7 columns: ID, name, address, email, contact, gender, qualification, and ethnicity. Make sure to set the ID column as the PRIMARY KEY and check the A_I (Auto Increment) option.

6. Now, extract the folder provided and move it to the 'htdocs' folder in your XAMPP installation directory. Your folder path should look like this: Drive:\xampp\htdocs\'YourFolderName'.
